<h3>Information We Collect</h3><br>
<p> <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our website using cookies and other devices. We use this information for internal research on our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include (but is not limited to) the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.

    <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> <br>

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs.<br>

Placeholder only collects such personal information that is necessary for you to use our services. This personal information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, mailing address, zip/postal code, email address, financial information, and other personal information necessary to satisfy legal requirements.<br>

As a matter of policy, we will never sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.<br>

Your personally identifiable information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States, United Kingdoms or Canada. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may differ from the Canadian laws but as we explain below, we will hold and transmit your information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.<br>

<b>Our Use of Your Information</b><br>

<p>
<b>Our Disclosure of Your Information</b><br>

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government and law enforcement agencies.

    <br>
    <p>
<b>Security</b><br>

Placeholder treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
<b>Notice</b><br>

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy modification date below.
